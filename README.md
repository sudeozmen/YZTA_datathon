# Sales Price Prediction Project


This project focuses on predicting product sales prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as product details, production location, market, city, and date information.

The main steps involved:

+ Data exploration and preprocessing

+ Feature engineering (splitting date into year and month)

+ Label encoding for categorical variables

+ Model training using Random Forest Regressor

+ Evaluation using RMSE on both training and validation sets

+ Generating predictions for the test set and creating a submission file

I participated in this project as part of a Kaggle competition organized by Google AI Academy aiming to improve sales price prediction accuracy.
